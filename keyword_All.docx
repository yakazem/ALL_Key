7	C memory layout	We can draw the memory layout as one long array with 232232 elements, where each element is one byte. The leftmost element has address 0x00000000, and the rightmost element has address 0xFFFFFFFF.3



 

However, this is hard to read, so we usually draw memory as a grid of bytes. In the grid, the bottom-left element has address 0x00000000, and the top-right element has address 0xFFFFFFFF. Addresses increase as you move from left to right and from bottom to top.


 


 

Little-endian words
x86 is a little-endian system. This means that when storing a word in memory, the least significant byte is stored at the lowest address, and the most significant byte is stored at the highest address. For example, here we are storing the word 0x44332211 in memory:


 


	
8	Registers	Data is stored in the registers using ‚ÄúLittle Endian‚Äù, right to letf: value 0x12345678 is stored like

16	IRQL (Interrupt ReQuest Level)	Interrupt ReQuest Level
üîß Interrupt Request Level (IRQL) in Windows
The Interrupt Request Level (IRQL) is a prioritization scheme used by the Windows kernel to manage hardware and software interrupt servicing across processors. It helps determine when and how different types of code (e.g., ISRs, DPCs, threads) execute.
17	IRQL Hierarchy (Simplified)
IRQL	Level	Description
PASSIVE_LEVEL	0	Normal thread execution, pageable code allowed.
APC_LEVEL	1	Used by APCs (Asynchronous Procedure Calls).
DISPATCH_LEVEL	2	Used for DPCs; thread preemption disabled.
DIRQL	3‚Äì31	Device Interrupt Request Levels (Device ISRs run here).
HIGH_LEVEL	31	Reserved by kernel, extremely rare use.


‚öôÔ∏è IRQL and the Kernel
‚Ä¢	The Windows scheduler only runs threads at PASSIVE_LEVEL or APC_LEVEL.
‚Ä¢	ISRs (Interrupt Service Routines) execute at DIRQL or above.
‚Ä¢	DPCs execute at DISPATCH_LEVEL.

üß™ Example: ISR and DPC IRQL Handling
1.	A device raises an interrupt ‚Üí ISR is invoked at DIRQL.
2.	ISR performs minimal work and queues a DPC.
3.	DPC runs later at DISPATCH_LEVEL (more flexible).
4.	Normal thread execution resumes at PASSIVE_LEVEL.


 

In Windows operating systems, IRQL, ISR, and DPC are concepts related to managing hardware interrupts and processing them efficiently. IRQL (Interrupt Request Level) defines the priority of interrupts, ISR (Interrupt Service Routine) is the code that handles a specific interrupt, and DPC (Deferred Procedure Call) is a mechanism to defer work from the ISR to a lower IRQL


Explanation:
‚Ä¢	IRQL (Interrupt Request Level):
IRQL is a numerical value that represents the priority of an interrupt. Higher IRQL values indicate higher priority. Interrupts with higher IRQLs can interrupt those with lower IRQLs. The IRQL range varies depending on the processor architecture (0-31 for x86, 0-15 for x64). 
‚Ä¢	ISR (Interrupt Service Routine):
An ISR is a special function that the operating system executes in response to a hardware interrupt. When an interrupt occurs, the system jumps to the ISR for that interrupt to handle it. ISRs must be executed quickly and efficiently to minimize latency. 
‚Ä¢	DPC (Deferred Procedure Call):
Because ISRs need to be short and efficient, they often defer complex work to DPCs. DPCs are queued by the ISR to be executed later, typically at a lower IRQL (e.g., DISPATCH_LEVEL) than the ISR. This allows the ISR to return quickly and allows the CPU to perform other tasks while the DPC handles the remaining work. 
Why use DPCs?
‚Ä¢	Performance:
ISRs must be short to avoid blocking other operations. DPCs allow the ISR to handle the interrupt quickly and defer longer, more complex tasks to the DPC. 
‚Ä¢	System stability:
By performing tasks at lower IRQLs, DPCs reduce the risk of system instability caused by long operations at higher IRQLs. 
‚Ä¢	Flexibility:
DPCs can be executed in a different context (thread) than the ISR, allowing for more flexible resource management. 
In summary:
IRQLs manage interrupt priority, ISRs handle interrupts directly, and DPCs defer work from ISRs to lower IRQLs, improving system performance and stability.

27	Common UNICODE_STRING functions	Function Description
RtlInitUnicodeString Initializes a UNICODE_STRING based on an existing C-string
pointer. It sets Buffer, then calculates the Length and sets
MaximumLength to the same value. Note that this function does
not allocate any memory - it just initializes the internal members.
RtlCopyUnicodeString Copies one UNICODE_STRING to another. The destination string
pointer (Buffer) must be allocated before the copy and
MaximumLength set appropriately.
RtlCompareUnicodeString Compares two UNICODE_STRINGs (equal, less, greater), specifying
whether to do a case sensitive or insensitive comparison.
RtlEqualUnicodeString Compares two UNICODE_STRINGs for equality, with case
sensitivity specification.
RtlAppendUnicodeStringToString Appends one UNICODE_STRING to another.
RtlAppendUnicodeToString Appends UNICODE_STRING to a C-style string.

It instruments the kernel with code coverage tracking, which allows the fuzzer to determine which parts of the kernel code have been executed during the fuzzing process. This information is then used to guide the fuzzer towards unexplored or less-covered code paths, increasing the chances of finding vulnerabilities.

It's worth noting that kernel fuzzing can be a complex and resource-intensive process. It may require specialized knowledge and tools to set up a suitable fuzzing environment and handle kernel-specific challenges. Therefore, it is recommended to use established fuzzing frameworks like AFL, libFuzzer, or honggfuzz, as they provide the necessary tools and infrastructure for effective kernel fuzzing.

The Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is a proprietary protocol designed by Microsoft which allows the user of an RDP Client software to connect to a remote computer over the network with a graphical interface. Its use around the world is very widespread; some people, for instance, use it often for remote work and administration.

86	Disclosure Processes		
87	vulnerability disclosure processes:	Three different models are commonly used in vulnerability disclosure processes:
1. No disclosure: No details of the vulnerability, nor even the existence of the
vulnerability, are disclosed publicly. 
2. Partial disclosure: This is the most common means of disclosure in the
industry. 
3. Full disclosure: All details of the vulnerability, including possible exploitation
techniques, are disclosed publicly. In this model, each reader with
enough skill can analyze the problem and prioritize it accordingly. Sometimes
users decide to deploy the vendor-provided patches, but they can also
build other means of protecting against attacks targeting the vulnerability,
including deploying IDS/IPS systems or firewalls.

the following:
1. Graphical User Interface (GUI);
2. Command Line User Interface (CLI);
3. Programming Interfaces (API);
4. Files;
5. Local network loops (RPC, Unix sockets or pipes, etc.);
6. Physical hardware access.

113	Memory Layout Sections	The program itself only contains instruction only but a process has more part which are:
1.	Stack Section
2.	Heap Section
3.	Data Section
4.	Text Section
 
113.1.1	1. Stack Section
This section contains local variable, function and returns address. As in the diagram show stack and heap grow in opposite direction which is obvious if both grow in the same direction then they may overlap so it is good if they grow in opposite direction.
Example:
Below function when called will be stored in stack section
int fun(int a)
{
	return (a+1);
}
As soon as function return the values stack section for that function will get deleted.
113.1.2	2. Heap Section
This Section is used to provide dynamic memory whenever memory is required by the program during runtime It is provided form heap section.
In C language: malloc() and calloc() is used for this purpose
A statement like: malloc(4) will return the starting address of the 4 BYTE block which is in heap area.
It is important to note that in C language this dynamic memory needs to be handled i.e. freed when there is no need of it, otherwise heap will become full after some time.
So, free() function is used in the C program to do so.
113.1.3	3. Data Section
This Section contains the global variables and static local variables.
For example in C program
#include<stdio.h>
int glbal _var ; // stored in data section 
int main()
{
	static int var ;  // stored in data section
	// code statement
	return 0;
}
113.1.4	4. Text Section
This section contains the executable instruction, constants, and macros, it is read-only location and is sharable so that can be used by another process also.
	
114	Memory Leaks		
115	Memory corruption	Memory corruption is a process of unintentionally alterting a random area of memory by a program or process.

116	/GS	116.1	Guard buffer with signature
Here we are allocating some extra memory at the beginning and at the end of each memory unit. After allocation we are applying some character pattern to this extra memory.
This helps us to detect the corruption. When anyone writes beyond the allocated memory blocks, these character patterns will be modified and we can easily detect the corruption. Please note that this memory corruption checker is very tricky and may not work in all situations.
Allocated blocks will look like this-
"XYXYXYXY<- BUFFER 1->XYXYXYXY""XYXYXYXY<- BUFFER 2->XYXYXYXY"
When buffer2 will overflow, it will corrupt/overwrite trailing pattern and memory block will look like
"XYXYXYXY<- BUFFER 1->XYXYXYXY""XYXYXYXY<- BUFFER 2 ->XYXY"

User processes
These are normal processes based on image files, executing on the system, such as instances of
Notepad.exe, cmd.exe, explorer.exe and so on.
‚Ä¢ Subsystem DLLs
Subsystem DLLs are dynamic link libraries (DLLs) that implement the API of a subsystem. A
subsystem is a certain view of the capabilities exposed by the kernel. Technically, starting from
Windows 8.1, there is only a single subsystem ‚Äì the Windows Subsystem. The subsystem DLLs
include well-known files, such as kernel32.dll, user32.dll, gdi32.dll, advapi32.dll, combase.dll
and many others. These include mostly the officially documented API of Windows.
‚Ä¢ NTDLL.DLL
A system-wide DLL, implementing the Windows native API. This is the lowest layer of code
which is still in user mode. Its most important role is to make the transition to kernel mode
for system call invocation. NTDLL also implements the Heap Manager, the Image Loader and
some part of the user mode thread pool.
‚Ä¢ Service Processes
Service processes are normal Windows processes that communicate with the Service Control
Manager (SCM, implemented in services.exe) and allow some control over their lifetime. The
SCM can start, stop, pause, resume and send other messages to services. Services typically
execute under one of the special Windows accounts ‚Äì local system, network service or local service.
Executive
The Executive is the upper layer of NtOskrnl.exe (the ‚Äúkernel‚Äù). It hosts most of the code that is
in kernel mode. It includes mostly the various ‚Äúmanagers‚Äù: Object Manager, Memory Manager,
I/O Manager, Plug & Play Manager, Power Manager, Configuration Manager, etc. It‚Äôs by far
larger than the lower Kernel layer.
‚Ä¢ Kernel
The Kernel layer implements the most fundamental and time sensitive parts of kernel mode OS
code. This includes thread scheduling, interrupt and exception dispatching and implementation
of various kernel primitives such as mutex and semaphore. Some of the kernel code is written
in CPU-specific machine language for efficiency and for getting direct access to CPU-specific
details.
‚Ä¢ Device Drivers
Device drivers are loadable kernel modules. Their code executes in kernel mode and so has the
full power of the kernel. This book is dedicated to writing certain types of kernel drivers.
‚Ä¢ Win32k.sys
The ‚Äúkernel mode component of the Windows subsystem‚Äù. Essentially this is a kernel module
(driver) that handles the user interface part of Windows and the classic Graphics Device Interface
(GDI) APIs. This means that all windowing operations (CreateWindowEx, GetMessage,
PostMessage, etc.) are handled by this component. The rest of the system has little-to-none
knowledge of UI.
‚Ä¢ Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)
The HAL is an abstraction layer over the hardware closest to the CPU. It allows device drivers to
use APIs that do not require detailed and specific knowledge of things like Interrupt Controller
or DMA controller. Naturally, this layer is mostly useful for device drivers written to handle
hardware devices.
‚Ä¢ System Processes
System processes is an umbrella term used to describe processes that are typically ‚Äújust there‚Äù,
doing their thing where normally these processes are not communicated with directly. They are
important nonetheless, and some in fact, critical to the system‚Äôs well-being. Terminating some
of them is fatal and causes a system crash. Some of the system processes are native processes,
meaning they use the native API only (the API implemented by NTDLL). Example system
processes include Smss.exe, Lsass.exe, Winlogon.exe, Services.exe and others.
‚Ä¢ Subsystem Process
The Windows subsystem process, running the image Csrss.exe, can be viewed as a helper to
the kernel for managing processes running under the Windows system. It is a critical process,
meaning if killed, the system would crash. There is normally one Csrss.exe instance per
session, so on a standard system two instances would exist ‚Äì one for session 0 and one for the
logged-on user session (typically 1). Although Csrss.exe is the ‚Äúmanager‚Äù of the Windows
subsystem (the only one left these days), its importance goes beyond just this role.
‚Ä¢ Hyper-V Hypervisor
The Hyper-V hypervisor exists on Windows 10 and server 2016 (and later) systems if they
support Virtualization Based Security (VBS). VBS provides an extra layer of security, where
the actual machine is in fact a virtual machine controlled by Hyper-V. VBS is beyond the scope
of this book. For more information, check out the Windows Internals book.

185	Zombie Processes	A zombie process is a process that has terminated but has not been cleaned up yet. It
is the responsibility of the parent process to clean up its zombie children.The wait
functions do this, too, so it‚Äôs not necessary to track whether your child process is still

187	ISR (Interrupt Service Routine)		ISR (Interrupt Service Routine)

An Interrupt Service Routine (ISR) is a hardware interrupt handler ‚Äî a small, fast function written by driver developers that runs in kernel mode when a device raises an interrupt (e.g., keyboard input, network packet, timer tick, etc.).
üö¶ When and Why is an ISR Called?
An ISR is triggered asynchronously by hardware events. For example:
‚Ä¢	A NIC (network card) receives data ‚Üí raises an interrupt ‚Üí ISR runs.
‚Ä¢	A disk I/O completes ‚Üí ISR handles the completion.

 

188	Types of Interrupts
188.1	Hardware Interrupts
Hardware interrupts are signals generated by external hardware devices to request attention from the CPU. These interrupts are asynchronous, meaning they can occur at any time, regardless of the CPU‚Äôs current state.
Examples:
‚Ä¢	I/O Interrupts: Triggered by input/output devices such as keyboards, mice, disks, network interfaces, and serial ports to indicate data availability or completion of an operation.
‚Ä¢	Timer Interrupts: Generated by programmable interval timers (PITs) or real-time clocks to signal the expiration of a specified time interval. Timekeeping commonly uses these interruptions to schedule tasks and implement time-sensitive operations.
‚Ä¢	Hardware Error Interrupts: Indicate hardware malfunctions, faults, or exceptional conditions, such as parity errors, bus errors, or device failures.
‚Ä¢	External Interrupts: Generated by external signals or events not directly related to I/O devices, such as power failure, hardware reset, or signal from a peripheral controller.
‚Ä¢	Prioritization: Hardware interrupts are typically prioritized based on their urgency or importance. Some systems employ interrupt controllers to manage interrupt priorities and efficiently handle multiple interrupt requests.
188.2	Software Interrupts
Software interrupts, also known as traps or exceptions, are signals generated by the CPU in response to specific conditions or instructions encountered during program execution. Unlike hardware interrupts, software interrupts are synchronous and are initiated by executing specific software instructions or encountering predefined conditions.
Examples:
‚Ä¢	System Calls: Software interrupts used by user programs to request services or functionalities the operating system provides. Common system calls include file I/O operations, process management, memory allocation, and communication with peripheral devices.
‚Ä¢	Exceptions: Interrupts generated by the CPU to indicate exceptional conditions or errors encountered during program execution. Examples include divide-by-zero errors, invalid memory accesses (segmentation faults), page faults, and protection violations.
‚Ä¢	Interrupt Instructions: Special instructions, such as the INT (interrupt) instruction on x86 architecture, used to trigger software interrupts explicitly.

6.	Importance of ISRs:

 1. What is ISR?
Interrupt Service Routine (ISR) is a specialized function or routine that is called when an interrupt is triggered by a hardware device. When a hardware event occurs, like a timer reaching a specific value or a button being pressed, it sends an interrupt signal to the processor.
During an interrupt, the processor automatically switches to the ISR, which handles the specific task associated with the interrupt (such as reading data from a device or acknowledging the interrupt). ISRs are critical for real-time systems and embedded applications, ensuring that the CPU responds swiftly to hardware events without disrupting normal program flow.
 2. How ISR works ?
‚Ä¢	Interrupt Occurrence: A hardware device triggers an interrupt (e.g., timer reaching a specific value, keypress, data arrival from a network interface).
‚Ä¢	Interrupt Controller: The system's interrupt controller detects and prioritizes the interrupt based on its type and configuration.
‚Ä¢	Context Switch: The processor temporarily suspends the current program, saving its state (e.g., program counter, registers) to the stack during a context switch.
‚Ä¢	ISR Execution: Control transfers to the ISR associated with the triggered interrupt. The ISR performs necessary tasks, such as reading device data, acknowledging the interrupt, and initiating further actions.
‚Ä¢	Interrupt Handling: Once the ISR completes its tasks, it signals the interrupt controller that the interrupt has been serviced.
‚Ä¢	Context Restoration: The processor restores the saved state (context) of the interrupted program from the stack.
‚Ä¢	Resuming Execution: The processor resumes executing the interrupted program from where it left off.

 

189	3. Context Restoration and Resuming Execution:
1.Context Restoration:
‚Ä¢	
o	The processor restores the previously saved program state (context) from the stack.
o	This involves retrieving the saved program counter and register values to resume execution of the interrupted program.
2.Resuming Execution:
‚Ä¢	
o	The processor resumes execution of the program from the point where it was interrupted, continuing with its normal flow.
o	The interrupted program may now incorporate any changes made by the ISR in response to the hardware event
190	4. How ISR is Setup to a function:
Function for the ISR is selected by mapping or loading the function address into a predfined hardware memory table called vector table.
1. Vector Table Overview
A vector table is a data structure used by microcontrollers and processors to manage interrupts. It consists of a list of addresses known as interrupt vectors, each corresponding to a specific interrupt source or event.
2. Interrupt Vector Number
Each interrupt source in the system is assigned a unique number, often referred to as an interrupt vector number.
3. Mapping Interrupt Vectors to ISRs
The vector table maps these interrupt vector numbers to the corresponding addresses of the ISRs. For example, if an interrupt vector number n corresponds to a specific interrupt source (such as a timer interrupt), the vector table entry at index n will contain the address of the ISR responsible for handling that interrupt.
4. Processor Configuration
During system initialization or configuration, the processor's interrupt controller is programmed to use the vector table.
The interrupt controller is responsible for detecting and prioritizing interrupts, then fetching the corresponding ISR address from the vector table for handling.
5. Handling an Interrupt
When an interrupt occurs (e.g., a timer reaches a specified value, a key is pressed), the interrupt controller identifies the interrupt source and its associated vector number.
The interrupt controller uses this vector number to index into the vector table and retrieve the address of the corresponding ISR.
191	5. Key Characteristics of ISRs:
1.	Quick Execution: ISRs are designed to respond rapidly to hardware events, executing tasks efficiently. Lengthy or blocking operations within an ISR can degrade system performance.
2.	Deterministic Behavior: ISRs must behave predictably, completing tasks within defined timeframes. Unpredictable ISR execution times can lead to system instability or missed interrupts.
3.	Minimal Resource Usage: ISRs should use minimal system resources to operate effectively. This involves avoiding excessive memory usage, refraining from blocking other interrupts for extended periods, and maintaining lightweight operations.
6. Example Scenario: In a microcontroller-based system:
1.	A timer interrupt occurs when a predefined time interval elapses.
2.	The processor immediately transfers control to the Timer ISR.
3.	The Timer ISR updates a software counter or performs a periodic task.
4.	Upon completion, normal program execution seamlessly resumes
192	7. Importance of ISRs:
ISRs are critical for real-time systems and embedded applications that demand timely responses to hardware events. They facilitate efficient multitasking by enabling the CPU to manage multiple tasks concurrently without continuously checking for events.
	
193	DPC (Deferred Procedure Call)
	Deferred Procedure Call

A Deferred Procedure Call (DPC) is a kernel mechanism that defers the execution of low-priority tasks that originate from high-priority or interrupt contexts. This allows the Windows kernel to minimize time spent at high interrupt levels (IRQL) and maintain system responsiveness.
	
194	The Standard Model for IRP Processing
	
Particle physics has its "standard model" for the universe, and so does WDM. Figure 5-5 illustrates a typical flow of ownership for an IRP as it progresses through various stages in its life. Not every type of IRP would go through these steps, and some of the steps might be missing or altered depending on the type of device and the type of IRP. Notwithstanding the possible variability, however, the picture provides a useful starting point for discussion.

196	What is the relationship and relationship between irp, isr, dpc, irql, dirql?	The relationship between IRP, ISR, DPC, IRQL, and DIRQL reflects how Windows manages interrupt handling, device I/O, and asynchronous processing in the kernel. These components are tightly coupled in the Windows Driver Model (WDM) and play a critical role in the flow of hardware events and I/O requests.

Step-by-Step Breakdown
1. IRP (I/O Request Packet)
‚Ä¢	IRPs are kernel-mode data structures used to communicate I/O operations.
‚Ä¢	Created by the I/O Manager in response to requests like ReadFile().
‚Ä¢	Passed to device drivers via their DispatchRead, DispatchWrite, etc.
2. ISR (Interrupt Service Routine)
‚Ä¢	Registered via IoConnectInterruptEx().
‚Ä¢	Runs at DIRQL ‚Äî a hardware-defined IRQL level specific to the device.
‚Ä¢	Must run quickly; can‚Äôt perform long operations (e.g., memory allocation).
‚Ä¢	Common ISR tasks:
o	Acknowledge the device.
o	Capture critical info (e.g., buffer pointer).
o	Queue a DPC for deferred handling.
3. DPC (Deferred Procedure Call)
‚Ä¢	Queued by ISR using IoRequestDpc(), KeInsertQueueDpc().
‚Ä¢	Runs at DISPATCH_LEVEL, which is lower than DIRQL.
‚Ä¢	Safe to perform longer/lower-priority operations (e.g., complete an IRP).
‚Ä¢	Can access pageable memory, take locks, complete I/O requests.
4. IRQL (Interrupt Request Level)
‚Ä¢	Controls priority of code execution in kernel.
‚Ä¢	Higher IRQL means higher priority, preempts lower IRQLs.
‚Ä¢	Ranges:
o	PASSIVE_LEVEL: Normal thread execution.
o	APC_LEVEL: Asynchronous Procedure Calls.
o	DISPATCH_LEVEL: DPCs and spinlocks.
o	DIRQL: Device-specific interrupts.
o	HIGH_LEVEL: System-critical code (e.g., crash dump).
5. DIRQL (Device IRQL)
‚Ä¢	Each device‚Äôs interrupt is assigned a DIRQL (e.g., 5, 7, 11...).
‚Ä¢	Depends on interrupt controller (e.g., APIC/IOAPIC routing).
‚Ä¢	Only one ISR per DIRQL can run at a time.

197	a windbg demo showing irql and dpc queuing	Here‚Äôs a WinDbg demo scenario that shows how to observe IRQL levels and Deferred Procedure Call (DPC) queuing in a live kernel debugging environment. This assumes you're using a VM (e.g., Hyper-V) and have kernel debugging enabled.
________________________________________
üß™ Scenario: Viewing IRQL and Queued DPCs in WinDbg
________________________________________
Step 1: Break into the Kernel
Ctrl+Break
________________________________________
Step 2: Check Current IRQL
!irql
‚Ä¢	Shows the current IRQL of the processor you're on.
‚Ä¢	Useful for confirming if you're running at PASSIVE_LEVEL, DISPATCH_LEVEL, etc.
________________________________________
Step 3: Check DPC Queues
!dpc
‚Ä¢	Lists DPCs queued for execution.
‚Ä¢	You‚Äôll see per-processor queues and their contents (e.g., routines scheduled via KeInsertQueueDpc).
________________________________________
Step 4: Simulate a Load (e.g., Network or Disk)
To get meaningful DPC activity:
‚Ä¢	On the target system, initiate I/O (like ping -t, or disk copy).
‚Ä¢	Then quickly break in again (Ctrl+Break) and re-run:
!dpc
________________________________________
Step 5: Dump Processor State
!prcb
‚Ä¢	Dumps the KPRCB (Processor Control Block).
‚Ä¢	Contains current IRQL and active DPCs.
________________________________________
Step 6: View DPC Object
Assume you saw a DPC struct at fffff800:
dt _KDPC fffff800`xxxxxxxx
‚Ä¢	Shows the target DPC object's fields (DeferredRoutine, etc).
________________________________________
Optional: Triggering a DPC Manually (Dev Testing Driver)
If you‚Äôre writing a test driver, queue a DPC manually:
KeInitializeDpc(&MyDpc, MyDpcRoutine, Context);
KeInsertQueueDpc(&MyDpc, NULL, NULL);
Then in WinDbg:
!dpc
and
bp MyDpcRoutine
g
________________________________________
üîÅ Transition IRQLs
To trace transitions, use:
!thread
Look for Current IRQL, Start Address, and context of what IRQL the thread is executing at.
________________________________________
Would you like a simple C driver to queue a DPC so you can test this live?

	
198	Callbacks	üß© User Callbacks in Windows: Overview
In Windows, user callbacks refer to mechanisms where user-mode code is invoked by the system or by a driver in response to certain events. These are essential in various areas of Windows programming, such as GUI handling, asynchronous I/O, window messages, and more.

.
________________________________________
üîÑ Common Types of User Callbacks in Windows
1. Window Procedure (WndProc) Callback
‚Ä¢	Called by the system when a window receives a message (like mouse or keyboard input).
cpp
CopyEdit
LRESULT CALLBACK WndProc(HWND hwnd, UINT msg, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam) {
    switch (msg) {
        case WM_PAINT:
            // Handle paint
            break;
        case WM_DESTROY:
            PostQuitMessage(0);
            break;
    }
    return DefWindowProc(hwnd, msg, wParam, lParam);
}
________________________________________
2. Asynchronous I/O Completion Callbacks
‚Ä¢	Registered via ReadFileEx, WriteFileEx, or IOCP.
cpp
CopyEdit
void CALLBACK FileIOCompletionRoutine(DWORD dwErrorCode, DWORD dwNumberOfBytesTransfered, LPOVERLAPPED lpOverlapped) {
    // Called when the file operation completes
}
________________________________________
3. Timer Callbacks
‚Ä¢	For use with SetTimer (user mode) or CreateTimerQueueTimer (more advanced).
cpp
CopyEdit
void CALLBACK TimerCallback(PVOID lpParam, BOOLEAN TimerOrWaitFired) {
    // Executed when timer elapses
}
________________________________________
4. Registered Wait Callbacks
‚Ä¢	Register a callback that runs when an event/signaled object is set.
cpp
CopyEdit
void CALLBACK WaitOrTimerCallback(PVOID lpParameter, BOOLEAN TimerOrWaitFired) {
    // Called when event is signaled
}
________________________________________
5. Thread Pool Callbacks
‚Ä¢	Windows Thread Pool APIs like CreateThreadpoolWork.
cpp
CopyEdit
void CALLBACK MyWorkCallback(PTP_CALLBACK_INSTANCE Instance, PVOID Context, PTP_WORK Work) {
    // Code executed by the thread pool
}
________________________________________
6. CSRSS Callbacks (System Internals)
‚Ä¢	Used in environment subsystems (e.g., Win32 subsystem).
‚Ä¢	Internal user-mode callbacks from kernel/CSRSS to manage UI, console, etc. (not accessible directly from apps).
	
199	Trap Dispatching	üß† Trap Dispatching in Windows: Overview
In Windows, trap dispatching refers to how the CPU and the operating system respond to exceptions, interrupts, and system calls. Traps are a kind of control transfer mechanism used to transition between user mode and kernel mode, or to handle exceptional conditions during execution.

Ntoskrnl.exe	Contains the actual system service implementations
________________________________________
202	üõ†Ô∏è Under the Hood: How a System Call Works
1.	User-mode code (e.g., app.exe) calls a Win32 API like CreateFile.
2.	Kernel32.dll maps this to NtCreateFile in Ntdll.dll.
3.	Ntdll.dll issues a software interrupt (int 0x2e on x86, syscall on x64) or SYSENTER instruction.
4.	The CPU switches to ring 0 (kernel mode).
5.	The system call dispatcher (KiSystemCall64) uses the system call number to index into the SSDT.
6.	The corresponding kernel function is executed (e.g., NtCreateFile in Ntoskrnl.exe).
7.	Result is returned to user mode.

210	 SRM	Security Reference Monitor	When NtOpenProcess is called, SRM in the kernel checks the caller‚Äôs access token against the target process's DACL.



Yes, SRM stands for Security Reference Monitor in Windows Internals.
211	üîê SRM ‚Äì Security Reference Monitor
212	üìå Definition:
The Security Reference Monitor (SRM) is a kernel-mode component of the Windows operating system responsible for enforcing the security policy on the local system. It mediates all access to securable objects and ensures that access control rules are obeyed.
________________________________________
213	üß† Key Responsibilities:
‚Ä¢	Performs access checks on objects (files, registry keys, processes, etc.)
‚Ä¢	Audits security events based on SACLs
‚Ä¢	Manages user rights (privileges) and token-based authorization
‚Ä¢	Interfaces with LSASS to evaluate policy decisions
________________________________________
214	üõ†Ô∏è Real-World Example:
Let‚Äôs say a process wants to open C:\secret.txt for writing:
1.	The process calls the WinAPI function CreateFile.
2.	This leads to a kernel call to NtCreateFile.
3.	The SRM checks the caller's access token against the file‚Äôs DACL.
4.	If access is permitted, a handle is returned; otherwise, access is denied.
________________________________________
215	üîç Debugging with WinDbg:
In a kernel debugging session, you might see SRM calls or policy enforcement via stack traces or logs involving:
‚Ä¢	SeAccessCheck
‚Ä¢	SeCreateAccessState
‚Ä¢	ObReferenceObjectByHandle
________________________________________
216	üìö References in Tools:
‚Ä¢	Process Monitor shows access denied errors when SRM blocks an access attempt.
‚Ä¢	AccessChk (from Sysinternals) reveals DACL entries that SRM would evaluate.
‚Ä¢	Security logs in the Event Viewer (Audit logs) may show SRM-triggered audits.

217	LSASS
Local Security Authority Subsystem Service
	lsass.exe stores password hashes; tools like Mimikatz can extract credentials if LSASS is not protected by Credential Guard.

üîê LSASS ‚Äì Local Security Authority Subsystem Service
üìå Definition:
LSASS.exe is a critical user-mode process in Windows responsible for enforcing security policies, handling user authentication, and generating access tokens. It works closely with SRM and authentication packages like Kerberos and MSV1_0.
________________________________________
üß† Key Responsibilities:
‚Ä¢	Authenticates users during login (via Winlogon, RDP, etc.)
‚Ä¢	Generates and manages access tokens
‚Ä¢	Enforces Account Policies (e.g., password complexity)
‚Ä¢	Supports Single Sign-On (SSO) using Kerberos
‚Ä¢	Logs security audit events (login failures, privilege use)
________________________________________
üõ†Ô∏è Real-World Examples:
üîë 1. User Login:
‚Ä¢	When a user logs in, Winlogon requests LSASS to authenticate credentials.
‚Ä¢	LSASS verifies the password using MSV1_0 or Kerberos.
‚Ä¢	On success, LSASS creates an access token containing:
o	User SID
o	Group SIDs
o	Privileges
o	Default DACL
‚Ä¢	The token is attached to processes like explorer.exe.
üö´ 2. Access Denial:
‚Ä¢	If a process tries to access a secured file, the SRM consults the token generated by LSASS.
‚Ä¢	If token privileges or SIDs don‚Äôt match the DACL, access is denied.
üéØ 3. Credential Dumping Attack (e.g., Mimikatz):
‚Ä¢	Attackers target lsass.exe to dump cleartext credentials, Kerberos tickets, and NTLM hashes.
‚Ä¢	Defensive tools (like Windows Defender Credential Guard) isolate LSASS in a protected process to prevent memory tampering.
________________________________________
üîç LSASS and Forensics:
‚Ä¢	Memory dumps of lsass.exe are rich in credential artifacts.
‚Ä¢	Tools like Volatility or Rekall extract logins, tickets, and hashes from LSASS memory.

  	
219	LSA
Local Security Authority
	Defines security policies and loads authentication packages such as Kerberos.dll.

Correct! Here's an expanded explanation with context:
________________________________________
LSA ‚Äì Local Security Authority
Definition:
The Local Security Authority (LSA) is a protected subsystem of Windows responsible for enforcing the security policy on the system. It manages user logins, generates access tokens, handles password changes, and creates audit logs.
________________________________________
üîê Real-World Role of LSA
Example Scenario:
When a user logs into a Windows machine:
1.	The user provides credentials (username/password).
2.	These credentials are passed to Winlogon, which contacts LSASS.exe (the user-mode part of LSA).
3.	LSA loads appropriate authentication packages like Kerberos (for domain logons) or MSV1_0 (for local logons).
4.	The credentials are validated against a SAM database or Active Directory.
5.	If authentication is successful, LSA creates a security access token.
6.	This token is attached to the user's session and all spawned processes.
________________________________________
üõ°Ô∏è LSA‚Äôs Key Responsibilities
Responsibility	Description
Authentication	Validates credentials using auth packages (Kerberos, MSV1_0, etc.)
Token Generation	Creates security tokens with SIDs, privileges, and default DACLs
Audit Logging	Logs successful and failed authentication attempts
Policy Enforcement	Applies local security policies (password complexity, account lockouts)
Secret Management	Stores service account passwords and private data in the LSA secrets area
________________________________________

Yes! Here's an explanation of SDDL with real-world context and examples:
________________________________________
 üîê SDDL ‚Äì Security Descriptor Definition Language
Definition:
SDDL is a compact string format used in Windows to define security descriptors‚Äîwhich include permissions (DACLs), auditing rules (SACLs), owner, and group‚Äîon securable objects like files, registry keys, and services.
________________________________________
 üìÑ SDDL Structure Format:
O:<owner_sid>G:<group_sid>D:<DACL>S:<SACL>
Each section:
‚Ä¢	O: ‚Äì Owner SID
‚Ä¢	G: ‚Äì Group SID
‚Ä¢	D: ‚Äì Discretionary Access Control List (DACL)
‚Ä¢	S: ‚Äì System Access Control List (SACL)
________________________________________
 ‚úÖ Real-World Example ‚Äì File Security
D:(A;;FA;;;SY)(A;;FA;;;BA)(A;;FA;;;S-1-5-21-...-1001)
üîç Breakdown:
‚Ä¢	D: ‚Äì DACL
‚Ä¢	(A;;FA;;;SY) ‚Äì Allow Full Access to LocalSystem
‚Ä¢	(A;;FA;;;BA) ‚Äì Allow Full Access to Built-in Administrators
‚Ä¢	(A;;FA;;;S-1-5-21-...-1001) ‚Äì Allow Full Access to a specific user SID
________________________________________
 üîß Where SDDL is Used:
Location	Example
File permissions	Set via icacls or in PowerShell
Registry permissions	Controlled via regini or regedit
Service security	Stored in SCM database; view with sc sdshow
WMI namespace security	Controlled using wmimgmt.msc or PowerShell
________________________________________
 üîê Example ‚Äì Viewing a Service‚Äôs SDDL
sc sdshow Schedule
Output:
D:(A;;CCDCLCSWRPWPDTLOCRSDRCWDWO;;;BA)(A;;CCDCLCSWRPWPDTLOCRSDRCWDWO;;;SY)
This says both Administrators (BA) and LocalSystem (SY) have full access to the Schedule service.

222	SID
Security Identifier
	S-1-5-18 is the SID for the LocalSystem account; each user or group has a unique SID.

Correct! Here's a detailed explanation of SID (Security Identifier) with real-world examples and context:
________________________________________
 üÜî SID ‚Äì Security Identifier
Definition:
A Security Identifier (SID) is a unique, immutable identifier that Windows assigns to every user, group, computer, or security principal. It is used by the operating system to manage permissions and track access to objects, not usernames or group names directly.
________________________________________
 üß© SID Structure Example:
S-1-5-21-3623811015-3361044348-30300820-1013
üîç Breakdown:
‚Ä¢	S ‚Äì Stands for SID
‚Ä¢	1 ‚Äì Revision level
‚Ä¢	5 ‚Äì Identifier authority (e.g., NT Authority)
‚Ä¢	21-... ‚Äì Domain or local computer identifier
‚Ä¢	1013 ‚Äì Relative ID (RID), uniquely identifying the user or group in the domain
________________________________________
 üîê Real-World SIDs
SID	Meaning
S-1-5-18	LocalSystem account
S-1-5-32-544	Administrators group (built-in)
S-1-5-19	LocalService account
S-1-5-21-xxx-500	Domain or local Administrator account
S-1-5-21-xxx-1001	Normal user (created after first account)
________________________________________
 üß† How SIDs Are Used
‚Ä¢	In Access Tokens: Your SID is embedded when you log in, defining your identity.
‚Ä¢	In DACLs/SACLs: Access permissions are granted or denied based on SIDs.
‚Ä¢	In Registry & File Permissions: Permissions refer to SIDs, not names.
‚Ä¢	In Event Logs: Security events log SIDs for traceability (e.g., logon events).
________________________________________
 üõ†Ô∏è Tools to View SIDs
Tool	Usage Example
whoami /user	View current user's SID
wmic useraccount get name,sid	View all user SIDs

________________________________________
 üì¶ IRP ‚Äì I/O Request Packet
Definition:
An IRP (I/O Request Packet) is a kernel-mode data structure used by the Windows I/O Manager to communicate between drivers and manage I/O operations like reading or writing to files, devices, or networks.
________________________________________
 üß† Why IRPs Matter
IRPs represent all types of I/O operations‚Äîsynchronous, asynchronous, buffered, direct‚Äîand are central to how Windows handles device communication.
________________________________________
 üß± Key Components of an IRP
Field	Purpose
MajorFunction	The main I/O operation (e.g., IRP_MJ_READ)
MinorFunction	Sub-operations (varies by major function)
IoStatus	Status code returned (e.g., success/failure)
Buffer	Data to/from user mode
AssociatedIrp	Links related IRPs (e.g., for split requests)
CurrentLocation	Tracks where the IRP is in the driver stack
________________________________________
 üîÑ IRP Flow in Real Life
 Example: Reading from a File
1.	A user process calls ReadFile().
2.	The I/O Manager creates an IRP.
3.	The IRP is passed through the driver stack (File System Driver ‚Üí Volume Manager ‚Üí Disk Driver).
4.	Each driver may:
o	Handle the IRP,
o	Pass it to the next lower driver,
o	Complete it.
5.	The result is returned to the user app.
________________________________________
 üîå IRP MajorFunction Examples
MajorFunction	Purpose
IRP_MJ_READ	Read data from a device
IRP_MJ_WRITE	Write data to a device
IRP_MJ_CREATE	Open/create a file/device
IRP_MJ_CLOSE	Close a file/device handle
IRP_MJ_DEVICE_CONTROL	Device-specific IOCTL
________________________________________
 üõ†Ô∏è Tools to Analyze IRPs
‚Ä¢	WinDbg: Use !irp command to view IRP stacks during kernel debugging.
‚Ä¢	Process Monitor: Captures I/O operations and interprets IRP activity.
‚Ä¢	Driver Verifier: Helps test IRP processing paths.

263	ALPC Advanced Local Procedure Call	Used by services and LSASS for fast, secure communication in user and kernel mode.

 


Certainly! Here's a detailed explanation of ALPC (Advanced Local Procedure Call) in Windows:
________________________________________
üß© What is ALPC (Advanced Local Procedure Call)?
ALPC stands for Advanced Local Procedure Call, and it is a high-performance, kernel-mode inter-process communication (IPC) mechanism used within the same Windows system. It allows processes‚Äîespecially user-mode apps and system services‚Äîto communicate securely and efficiently.
________________________________________
 üß† Why ‚ÄúAdvanced‚Äù?
ALPC is the evolved version of the original LPC (Local Procedure Call) mechanism. Microsoft introduced ALPC starting with Windows Vista to improve performance, flexibility, and security.
________________________________________
 üîß Key Features of ALPC:
Feature	Description
Kernel-managed	All messages are mediated by the kernel's ALPC subsystem.
Port-based communication	Clients and servers connect via ALPC ports (secure endpoints).
Shared memory support	For efficient large data transfer, ALPC supports shared memory sections.
Message-based	Communication uses small, structured messages.
Security descriptors	ALPC ports can be secured using ACLs, defining which users can connect.
Waitable communication	Processes can wait on ALPC ports like events or semaphores.
________________________________________
 üîÑ Typical ALPC Communication Flow:
1.	Server creates an ALPC port using NtCreatePort.
2.	Client connects to the server port using NtConnectPort.
3.	Messages are exchanged using NtRequestWaitReplyPort or NtAlpcSendWaitReceivePort.
4.	Optional: Shared memory regions can be used for high-throughput or bulk data transfer.
5.	Server and client close ports after communication.
________________________________________
 üì¶ Common Use Cases
Component	Usage of ALPC
LSASS	ALPC used for authentication/token services.
Winlogon	Communicates with services like LSASS.
Service Control Manager	Talks to service processes via ALPC.
User-mode drivers	Some drivers communicate with system components via ALPC.
RPCSS (RPC Subsystem)	Uses ALPC to implement certain secure communications.
________________________________________
 üîê Security and ALPC
‚Ä¢	ALPC ports have security descriptors to prevent unauthorized connections.
‚Ä¢	Used extensively in sandboxing (e.g., between AppContainer and system services).
‚Ä¢	All communications can be audited via ETW (Event Tracing for Windows) and Sysmon.
________________________________________
 üîç Real-World Example
When a user logs in:
‚Ä¢	The Winlogon process uses ALPC to communicate with LSASS to validate credentials.
‚Ä¢	The ALPC port is protected so only trusted processes can send requests.
________________________________________
 üõ†Ô∏è Tools to Analyze ALPC
Tool	What It Can Do
WinDbg	!alpc and !object to inspect ALPC ports.
Sysmon	Logs ALPC communications if configured.
Process Explorer	Can show ALPC port handles and endpoints.
ETW (Event Tracing for Windows)	Can trace ALPC messages and latencies.
________________________________________

Great! Here's a useful breakdown of:
________________________________________
264	üß≠ Common ALPC Port Names Used by Windows Services
These ALPC port names are kernel objects, typically in the \RPC Control\ or \BaseNamedObjects\ namespace.

\RPC Control\LSASS	LSASS	Handles authentication, token requests
\RPC Control\epmapper	RPC Endpoint Mapper	Resolves dynamic RPC endpoints
\RPC Control\DNSResolver	DNS Client Service	Resolves DNS queries via svchost
\RPC Control\samss	Security Account Manager	Handles user/group database queries
\RPC Control\protected_storage	Protected Storage	Access to stored credentials
\RPC Control\ntsvcs	Service Control Manager (SCM)	Manage system services
\RPC Control\LRPC	Windows RPC	Base LRPC channel (ALPC-based) for COM/RPC
\BaseNamedObjects\Restricted	AppContainers	Secure namespace for sandboxed apps
\RPC Control\spoolss	Print Spooler	Printer management
\RPC Control\audiosrv	Windows Audio Service	Manages audio sessions
These port names may be viewable in Process Explorer, WinDbg (!object \RPC Control), or using native API inspection tools.

‚Ä¢	RPC is a frequent target for privilege escalation, lateral movement, and wormable exploits (e.g., MS08-067, EternalBlue).
‚Ä¢	Firewall configuration and access control are essential to secure RPC services.
